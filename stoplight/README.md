# Lab 8 - Stoplight
## Part I - Tinkercad

- Visit https://www.tinkercad.com/
- Click Circuits > Create New Circuit
- Create a circuit to light up 3 light bulbs - *Remember each 3V coin battery is equivalent to a GPIO pin on your Raspberry Pi*
- Take a screenshot of your circuit

- [x] Take a screenshot of your circuit and upload it to this repository

## Part II - Python3

- Redo part I with real components; however, for your power source, use GPIO pins on your Raspberry Pi. _Turn off your Pi when connecting cables to the GPIO ports._
- Create a Python script `led_stoplight.py`  to recreate the following pattern out with your LEDs - Green for 5 seconds, then Yellow for 1 second,  Red for 4 seconds, then it repeats. _Do not use the stoplight sensor, use three individual LEDs._  
- You will need to import the `GPIO` and `time` libraries for this assignment.
- Add comments to your Python script to explain how it works.
- Take a short video of your stoplight working and a clear top-down photo of your wiring

- [x] Upload `led_stoplight.py`, the video, and the photo to this repository then continue to Part II

## Part III - RBG LED

- In a new script`rgb_stoplight.py`, repeat the previous two parts, this time using one 4 prong RGB LED, instead of 3 separate lights. This light should follow the same pattern switching from green, to yellow, to red.
- Add comments to your Python script to explain how it works.
- Take a clear top-down photo of your wiring

- [x] Upload `rgb_stoplight.py` and your photo then continue to Part IV

## Part IV - Starting with a Button

- In a new script `button_stoplight.py`, add a button or touch module to your project to start your RGB stoplight. When the button is pressed the light should light up in the green, yellow, red pattern.
- For your button module, `S` should be connected to a GPIO pin, `V` to 5V, and `G` to ground.
- In order to use a button, set the `S` pin to an input with `GPIO.setup(pin_number, GPIO.IN)`. It the button is pressed, `GPIO.input(pin_number)` will be equal to 0. If it is unpressed, `GPIO.input(pin_number)` will be equal to 1.
- Take a short video of your button starting the stoplight and the pattern appearing correctly

- [x] Upload `button_stoplight.py`  and the video to this repository then continue to
Part V - Wrap Up

## Part V - Wrap Up

- Make sure all the deliverables above are  uploaded to the repository
- Answer the following questions:

1. What is a Python library and how do you include one in your script?

   It's a project that somebody else has written and you can use for free. You can import it via "import library_name"
   at the top of the file.

2. What does it mean for elements of a circuits to be in series vs. in parallel?

Series circuits seperate parts of one circuit that are connected together. Parallel circuits are seperate circuits that are not connected.

3. Can you create a circuit of 3 light bulbs in series? Why or why not?

Yes you can except they will have progressivly weaker light strengths because you are powering 3 lights with one powersource.
